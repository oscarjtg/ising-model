# ising-model

Uses the Metropolis algorithm to numerically solve the Ising model for the net magnetisation of a ferromagnet at different temperatures.

A plot is produced for two different coupling constants J. 
The ferromagnet-to-paramagnet phase transition is observed at a higher temperature when the coupling constant is larger.
